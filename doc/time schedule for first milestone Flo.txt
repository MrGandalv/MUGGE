time schedule for first milestone

I want to build a programm which is build up in the same way our programm should end up but for the mnist-data and with tensorflow. 
I will only use very easy NN's (4 NN's with different achritecure) and the usage of those NN's might not make sense at all and at phase 5
I will just use the max of the output. 

With this I want to see what kind of implementation problems we might face when we try to build our programm.

So far I just wrote a NN with tensorflow keras.

 What is yet to come         |   estimated time for implementation (in days)
-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------
- phase 1: import mnist data | 0 d (this is just copy and paste because I already have this)
                             |
- phase 2: write copy routine| -
  or decide for a big array, |  |
  don't know yet             |  |
                             |  |
- phase 3: implementing      |  | (well, this is just copy and paste of one NN with different
  boxes.                     |  | numbers for the hidden layers)
                             |   - 1 d
- phase 4: extracting max    |  |
  and store them in a list   |  |
  and then parallelize it    |  |
                             |  |
- phase 5: taking the max    |  |
  of the list of phase 4     | -
                             |
- try to build the GUI (just | 1 d
  the look)                  | 
                             |
- see what I need to do, to  | 1 d
  make the GUI work properly |


So, in total 3 days which means Friday, Saturday and Sunday (05 - 07.06) just in time for the call with Prof. Iske.
