#  The following function is an auxiliary function for the main function 'write_feature_file'.
#  Here, for the 'mode' parameter only the states "w" (write) and "a" (append) are admissible.
#  If "a" is committed, the function opens the .csv file 'features_file_name', and 'line_to_add' is added
#  to the end of the file (in a new line). Gives an error, when 'features_file_name' does not exist.
#  If "w" is committed, it creates an empty .csv file with the name 'features_file_name', and 'line_to_add' is added
#  in the file (in the first line).
#  Important: In writting mode, an existing file with the same name will be erased/ overwritten.
#  The given file 'features_file_name' must be a .csv file.
#  The "with" statement ensures that the file will automatically be closed afterwards.

#  The 'write_feature_file' is the main function of this script.
#  The functions goal is to create a .csv file named 'features_file_name', with specified music features of
#  a given dataset of songs in it. Usually, the file can then be found in the directory of your current python
#  project. The created file starts with a headline, consisting of "filename", followed by the names of
#  the extracted features and ending with "label", i.e. the genre of the song. Every other row persists of the
#  extracted data of one song, structured in the same order as the headline.
#
#  The parameters 'features_file_name' (name of the desired .csv file)
#  and 'dataset_path' (the path, where the dataset is stored) should be committed as strings, e.g.
#  features_file_name= "music_features.csv",
#  dataset_path = "C:/Users/MaxM/PycharmProjects/music_project/music_data".
#
#  With the list of strings 'genrelist' and 'featurelist' one can specify, which genres from the database
#  should be considered and which features should be extracted. Use the .split() method to easily create
#  the wanted format from a pure string, e.g. genrelist="rock pop".split(),
#  featurelist="chroma_stft spectral_centroid zero_crossing_rate mfcc".split() .
#  Important: Dont forget spaces between the words! Also, right now, only the 4 features
#  "chroma_stft", "spectral_centroid", "zero_crossing_rate" and "mfcc" are supported. If other features are commited,
#  they wont be extracted and they cant be seen in the file. An Assertion-Error gets raised, if 'featurelist'
#  contains no supported features at all. The "mfcc" feature consists of 20 different features.
#
#  The integer 'max_songs_per_genre' can be used to limit the amount of extracted songs per genre,
#  e.g max_songs_per_genre=10 will extract features only from the first 10 songs from every genre.
#  A small number is useful to test, if all parameters are correctly committed and the created file has
#  the wanted format and information.
#
#  The last (string-)parameter 'overwrite' should be used in the following way: Only if explicitly "Yes" is
#  plugged in, an existing file with the same name as 'features_file_name' can be overwritten/erased. Thus, the
#  goal is here to prevent an accidental loss of an existing file, by setting, e.g. overwrite="".
#  Another option is to commit overwrite="Append". In this case one can extend an existing file with
#  the same name as 'features_file_name' by more data. This option is only useful to append different genres
#  step by step, not to add more features to an existing file, because then the structure of the file wont
#  be consistent.
#
#  A complete example for the use of the function is given below.
