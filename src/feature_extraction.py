""" The 'write_feature_file' is the main function of this script.
  The functions goal is to create a .csv file named 'features_file_name', with specified music features of
  a given dataset of songs in it. Usually, the file can then be found in the directory of your current python
  project. The created file starts with a headline, consisting of "filename", followed by the names of
  the extracted features and ending with "label", i.e. the genre of the song. Every other row persists of the
  extracted data of one song, structured in the same order as the headline.

  The parameters 'features_file_name' (name of the desired .csv file)
  and 'dataset_path' (the path, where the dataset is stored) should be committed as strings, e.g.
  features_file_name= "music_features.csv",
  dataset_path = "C:/Users/MaxM/PycharmProjects/music_project/music_data".

  With the list of strings 'genrelist' and 'featurelist' one can specify, which genres from the database
  should be considered and which features should be extracted. Use the .split() method to easily create
  the wanted format from a pure string, e.g. genrelist="rock pop".split(),
  featurelist="chroma_stft spectral_centroid zero_crossing_rate mfcc".split() .
  Important: Dont forget spaces between the words! Also, right now, only the 4 features
  "chroma_stft", "spectral_centroid", "zero_crossing_rate" and "mfcc" are supported. If other features are commited,
  they wont be extracted and they cant be seen in the file. An Assertion-Error gets raised, if 'featurelist'
  contains no supported features at all. The "mfcc" feature consists of 20 different features.

  The integer 'max_songs_per_genre' can be used to limit the amount of extracted songs per genre,
  e.g max_songs_per_genre=10 will extract features only from the first 10 songs from every genre.
  A small number is useful to test, if all parameters are correctly committed and the created file has
  the wanted format and information.

  The last (string-)parameter 'overwrite' should be used in the following way: Only if explicitly "Yes" is
  plugged in, an existing file with the same name as 'features_file_name' can be overwritten/erased. Thus, the
  goal is here to prevent an accidental loss of an existing file, by setting, e.g. overwrite="".
  Another option is to commit overwrite="Append". In this case one can extend an existing file with
  the same name as 'features_file_name' by more data. This option is only useful to append different genres
  step by step, not to add more features to an existing file, because then the structure of the file wont
  be consistent.

  A complete example for the use of the function is given below."""

    to the end of the file (in a new line). Gives an error, when 'features_file_name' does not exist.
