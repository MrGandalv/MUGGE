# This is an auxiliary function for the main function 'compute_data()'. For the given feature data 'X' and target
# data 'y', the function will split the data into a training and test set. Afterwards the given classifier will be
# trained with the training data and the accuracy of the classifier on the test data will be saved in a list. To make
# sure, that the result will not heavily depend on the train_test_split, this procedure should be done several times.
# This number of repetitions is specified by the parameter 'repetitions'. Because every classifier should be tested on
# the same splits, the 'random_state' parameter in 'train_test_split' is used. Finally the average accuracy (and the
# variance) is computed, by using the numpy library. To write the computed data in the file 'acc_file_name',
# the function 'append_data_to_file' from the script 'feature_extraction.py' is used. All in all, after calling the
# function, there will be a new line added into the file, consisting of the name of the classifier
# ('classifier_name'), the name of the used features ('feat_name') and the number of repetitions ('repetitions'),
# followed by the computed average accuracy, the variance and also the whole list of the accuracies.

# scaled/normalized. This data will be saved in the list 'feature_list', always paired with its description.
# Afterwards some classifiers are initialized and saved in a list, where again each of them is paired with its
# name/description. In the end, it only remains to call the function 'write_accuracy_to_file' for every feature and
# classifier combination to compute the accuracies and write it in the file 'acc_file_name'. When calling this
