# MUGGE
M.U.G.G.E. - Mostly Unfinished Genre Grading Engine


Welcome Stranger to the M.U.G.G.E.-Project! The aim of this project is to dive right into the algorithms, techniques, wonders and mathematics of machine learning based music genre classification.

Mugge (or also "Mucke") is an informal German synonym for a music performance (and inofficially but widly spread also for music itself).

We are Students of University of Hamburg (Germany).
